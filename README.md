Experiments with Verified Boot support on Android devices

This repo is intended to host a list of all devices which support verified boot with a custom OS, and also allow locking the bootloader with a custom OS installed.
It was usually only the Nexus, and later Pixel devices which supported this, but these days many other phones also support this.
I intend to catalog them.

The repo name, and the idea to have a list is totally copied from phh's https://github.com/phhusson/treble_experimentations

# TODOs
* Actually create and populate the list

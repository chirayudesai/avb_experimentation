Experiments with Verified Boot support on Android devices

This repo is intended to host a list of all devices which support verified boot with a custom OS, and also allow locking the bootloader with a custom OS installed.
It was usually only the Nexus, and later Pixel devices which supported this, but these days many other phones also support this.
I intend to catalog them.

The repo name, and the idea to have a list is totally copied from phh's [treble_experimentations](https://github.com/phhusson/treble_experimentations)

See the [wiki](https://github.com/chirayudesai/avb_experimentations/wiki) for a list of devices and more info.

# TODOs
* Add more devices to the list.
* Write a guide on the fastest way to check for and test this on any device.
* Include a list of custom ROMs supporting and using this feature, alongwith instructions on how to do it yourself.
